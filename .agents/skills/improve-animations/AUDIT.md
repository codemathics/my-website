# Animation Audit Playbook

The eight audit categories, what to look for in each, and the exact target values to cite in findings and plans. Distilled from Emil Kowalski's design engineering philosophy ([emilkowal.ski](https://emilkowal.ski/)). Never approximate a value that appears here — copy it.

## 1. Purpose & frequency

Every animation must answer "why does this animate?" — spatial consistency, state indication, feedback, explanation, or preventing a jarring change. "It looks cool" on a frequently-seen element is not a purpose.

| Frequency | Decision |
| --- | --- |
| 100+ times/day (keyboard shortcuts, command palette toggle) | No animation. Ever. |
| Tens of times/day (hover effects, list navigation) | Remove or drastically reduce |
| Occasional (modals, drawers, toasts) | Standard animation |
| Rare / first-time (onboarding, feedback, celebrations) | Can add delight |

Hunt for: animations on keyboard-initiated actions, command palettes with open/close transitions (Raycast has none — correct), decorative motion on list items or hover states hit constantly. The strongest fix is often **delete the animation**.

## 2. Easing & duration

Decision order for easing:

- Entering or exiting → **`ease-out`** (starts fast, feels responsive)
- Moving / morphing on screen → **`ease-in-out`**
- Hover / color change → **`ease`**
- Constant motion (marquee, progress) → **`linear`**
- Default → **`ease-out`**

**`ease-in` on UI is always a finding** — it starts slow, delaying the exact moment the user is watching. Built-in CSS easings are too weak for deliberate motion; plans should introduce strong custom curves (as tokens, matching repo conventions):

```css
--ease-out: cubic-bezier(0.23, 1, 0.32, 1);        /* strong ease-out for UI */
--ease-in-out: cubic-bezier(0.77, 0, 0.175, 1);    /* strong ease-in-out for on-screen movement */
--ease-drawer: cubic-bezier(0.32, 0.72, 0, 1);     /* iOS-like drawer curve */
```

Duration budgets — **most UI animations stay under 300ms**, with modals and drawers the documented exception at 200–500ms:

| Element | Duration |
| --- | --- |
| Button press feedback | 100–160ms |
| Tooltips, small popovers | 125–200ms |
| Dropdowns, selects | 150–250ms |
| Modals, drawers | 200–500ms |
| Marketing / explanatory | Can be longer |

Hunt for: `ease-in` anywhere, bare `ease`/`linear` on entrances, durations > 300ms on UI elements other than modals and drawers, modals and drawers past 500ms, tooltip delay + animation on every tooltip in a toolbar (after the first, they should be instant).

## 3. Physicality & origin

- **Never `scale(0)`** — nothing in the real world appears from nothing. Target: `scale(0.9–0.97)` + `opacity: 0`.
- **Popovers/dropdowns/tooltips scale from their trigger**, not center:
  ```css
  .popover { transform-origin: var(--transform-origin); } /* Base UI */
  ```
  **Modals are exempt** — they appear centered; `transform-origin: center` is correct there. Do not report it.
- **Press feedback**: `transform: scale(0.97)` on `:active` with `transition: transform 160ms ease-out`. Keep it subtle (0.95–0.98).

Hunt for: `scale(0)`, pure-fade entrances with no initial transform, `transform-origin: center` (or none) on trigger-anchored elements, pressable elements with no press feedback.

## 4. Interruptibility

CSS **transitions** retarget from the current state mid-animation; **keyframes** restart from zero. Anything triggered rapidly or reversible mid-motion (toasts stacking, toggles, drags, expand/collapse) must use transitions or springs.

- Entry without JS: `@starting-style` (legacy fallback: a `data-mounted` attribute set in `useEffect`).
- Gesture-driven motion should use springs — they carry velocity when interrupted.
- Spring configs, Apple-style (recommended): `{ type: "spring", duration: 0.5, bounce: 0.2 }`. Keep bounce subtle (0.1–0.3); reserve visible bounce for drag-to-dismiss and playful moments.
- **Asymmetric timing**: deliberate phases (press, hold, destructive confirm) animate slower; the system's response snaps. Symmetric timing on press-and-release is a finding.

Hunt for: `@keyframes` on toasts/toggles/rapidly-triggered UI, gesture handlers that tween with fixed-duration keyframes, drags without velocity-based dismissal (dismiss on `Math.abs(distance)/elapsedMs > ~0.11`, not distance thresholds alone), hard stops at drag boundaries instead of rising friction.

## 5. Performance

- **Prefer `transform` and `opacity`.** They are the only properties the compositor animates without layout or paint. `width`/`height`/`margin`/`padding`/`top`/`left` trigger layout + paint + composite, so they are a finding unless the interaction requires them.
- **`clip-path`, `filter`/`backdrop-filter`, and height transitions are documented exceptions**, not violations — categories 7 and 8 recommend them for reveals, crossfade masking, and accordions. They paint rather than composite, so acceleration is conditional: keep the animated area small and require profiling on the slowest target device rather than assuming the cost is free.
- **`transition: all`** animates unintended properties, including layout and paint ones — always a finding.
- **Motion's `x`/`y`/`scale` shorthands compile to `transform`** and so skip layout and paint. What can drop frames is the driver, not the property: independent transform values are composed per frame in JavaScript, so a blocked main thread stalls them, while a single `transform` string can take Motion's accelerated (WAAPI) path. Treat the shorthands as the ergonomic default and only target the full string when profiling shows dropped frames during main-thread work.
- **Don't drive child transforms via a CSS variable on the parent** — it recalcs styles for all children. Set `transform` directly on the element.
- CSS and WAAPI escape a busy main thread only for compositor-friendly properties; a CSS animation on `height` or `background-color` still does layout/paint every frame. Use CSS for predetermined motion, JS/springs for dynamic and gesture-driven motion, and measure under load.
- Keep transition-time `filter: blur()` under 20px — heavy blur is expensive, especially in Safari.

Hunt for: `transition: all`, animated layout properties with no stated reason, large-area `clip-path`/`filter` motion that was never profiled, `setProperty('--x', …)` driving child transforms, rAF loops doing what CSS could.

## 6. Accessibility

```css
@media (prefers-reduced-motion: reduce) {
  /* Keep the opacity/color feedback, drop the movement. */
  .element { transition: opacity 200ms ease; transform: none; }
}
@media (hover: hover) and (pointer: fine) {
  .element:hover { transform: scale(1.05); } /* touch fires false hovers on tap */
}
```

Reduced motion means fewer and gentler animations, **not zero** — keep transitions that aid comprehension, remove position changes. In JS: `useReducedMotion()` and branch transform values.

Hunt for: movement with no `prefers-reduced-motion` handling, ungated `:hover` motion, reduced-motion implementations that nuke all feedback.

## 7. Cohesion & tokens

- Motion should match the product's personality — playful can be bouncier, a dashboard stays crisp. Mismatched personality across components is a finding.
- Curves and durations should live as shared tokens. Five hand-typed cubic-beziers that almost match is a consolidation finding.
- Everything-at-once group entrances where a **30–80ms stagger** belongs. Stagger is decorative — it must never block interaction.
- A jarring crossfade that shows two overlapping states can be masked with subtle `filter: blur(2px)` during the transition — a documented paint-cost exception per category 5, so keep the blurred area small and profile it.

Hunt for: duplicated near-identical easings/durations, one bouncy component in a crisp app, list/grid entrances with no stagger, crossfades that visibly double-expose.

## 8. Missed opportunities

The additive category — places that don't animate but should:

- State changes that teleport (content swaps, layout jumps) where a brief transition would prevent a jarring change.
- Spatially-connected UI (a panel that appears from a trigger) with no motion explaining where it came from.
- Rare, high-emotion moments (first-run, success, celebration) rendered with none of the delight budget they're allowed.
- `translate` percentages (`translateY(100%)` = element's own height) and `clip-path: inset()` reveals as tools for these — no hardcoded pixel offsets.

Report at most a handful, grounded in actual UX seams you observed — not a wishlist.
